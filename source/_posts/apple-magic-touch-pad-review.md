# Apple Magic Touchpad Review

## Pros
To be honest, I still don't know.

## Cons

1. Its polling rate is only 90Hz.
2. It uses a very laggy wireless connection method.
3. The glass surface is not smooth enough.
4. The pressure sensor performs bad on the edges.  
5. Bad algorithm to tell `drag` and `move`.
